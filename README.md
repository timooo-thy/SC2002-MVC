# NTU SCSE SC2002 OODP Assignment
 FYP Registration System Application (FYPRSA)
 
 ## About
 In today's academic environment, Final Year Projects play a crucial role in every university student. It is essential to have an efficient system that can manage and monitor the progress of these projects, which involves collaboration between Students, Supervisors, and the FYP Coordinator. 
 
 The system needs to be scalable, modular, and easy to maintain, which can be achieved using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture in Java. OOP principles provide a clear separation of concerns, while MVC Architecture ensures a clear distinction between the Model, View and Controller layers. 
 
This project system can have different user roles with specific permissions, enabling Students to upload requests for project, Supervisors to evaluate and assign the projects, and the FYP Coordinator to manage and monitor the overall progress of the projects.
